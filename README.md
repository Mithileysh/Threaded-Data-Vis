# Threaded Message Visualisations

The repository serves to showcase various visualisations to analyse threaded
discussion data which consists of topics, groups, and individual users.

### Demo
https://mithileysh.github.io/Threaded-Data-Vis/

### Visualisations

- User level visualisations
- Group level visualisations
- Topic level visualisations

### To Do

- Add heat map between Group IDs and Topic IDs
- Remove aggregate objects as global variables (because of event handlers causing closures around them)
